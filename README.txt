The Evolution of Cooperative Communication


[requires GL/glut and GL/gl libraries]

This was a fun little project I did for a class in Grad School.

In this simulation, "Lions" and "Lionesses" attempt to find food and mate with each other in a challenging environment. Over many generations, cooperative communication emerges as an evolved trait.

The lions' food-gathering and communication patterns are encoded in a simple "genotype" which evolves through natural selection and the sexual pairing of a male and female "phenotypes". Lions must learn to cooperate and share to fend off scavenging vultures. Explores area of game theory such as: will evolution converge to a Nash Equilibrium?
